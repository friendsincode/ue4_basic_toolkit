# UE4 Basic Toolkit
This is my collection of useful reusable parts of UE4 content, ready to be used to quickly get projects started.

This isn't a complete project- instead it's a drop-in which you can copy over to your own project.  There's also a **Demo_Maps** folder which includes some simple maps which you can look at to see how things work, and then safely delete once you're happy.

The RMA (Roughess/Metallic/Ambient) maps here were processed using the ```convert.exe``` file which is part of [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) to combine the separate roughness, metallic and ambient occlusion maps into a single image.  The command to do this is:
```convert.exe ground_grass_Roughness.png ground_grass_Metallic.png ground_grass_Ambient_Occlusion.png -combine ground_grass_RMA.png```
